👋 Hi there, @EffandiAhmadTurk!

👀 I’m interested in cinema, philosophy, and of course, coding! I love exploring new ideas and finding creative solutions to technical challenges.

🌱 I’m currently learning and expanding my skills in various technologies, including Vue.js, React.js, Next.js, CMS, and Firebase. I believe in continuous learning to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the tech world.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that involve web development and cutting-edge technologies. I'm always open to working with passionate and like-minded individuals who share the same enthusiasm for creating exceptional solutions.

📫 You can reach me through my GitHub profile (@EffandiAhmadTurk). Feel free to explore my repositories and projects and drop me a message if you'd like to collaborate or discuss anything related to code, cinema, philosophy, or any other shared interests. Let's connect and create something amazing together! 😊
